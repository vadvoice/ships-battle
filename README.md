# Ship Battle Board Game

This is a Next.js project that implements a two-player board game called Ship Battle. The game is played on a grid where each player places their ships and takes turns firing at their opponent's ships. The game is won by the player who sinks all of their opponent's ships first.

### [Ships Battle Demo](https://ships-battle.vercel.app/)


## Tech side
The project uses `create-next-app` to bootstrap the application and `socket.io` to enable real-time communication between players. The game can be played in both single-player and two-player modes.

## Getting Started

To run the development server, use the following command:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
